# Bitcoin

Wrapping our minds around what bitcoin is, what is special about it, and what it aims to achieve is plain hard. Whether you want to love it or hate it, _understanding_ it is the first step of the journey. Most often, we don't even know what to ask or where to start. 

The following are starting points to explore what bitcoin is and what makes the project important and special. They are neither exhaustive nor meant to be used for in-depth learning or worse, gospel, but rather as places to sink your teeth into, grapple with the concepts foundational to bitcoin, and maybe start asking your nearest bitcoin enthusiast some questions.

_Some of the basics to get you going._

<br>

### Bitcoin is permissionless
You don't need any permission to develop on bitcoin, or to use bitcoin. This is a cornerstone of the system. You don't need an ID to send a payment, to recieve a payment, or to write another programming language library and integrate bitcoin into your website or business. Connect to the network, and you can use it.

<br>

### Bitcoin is open
Bitcoin is open for everyone to participate. This include its governance, its implementation, and its code. Everything is out in the open. There is no "insider information", no secret meetings. The code is open source, and the process through which the many bitcoin implementations change and upgrade is for all to see, comment, debate, and participate in. Come and join us.

<br>

### Bitcoin is a neutral network
Bitcoin doesn't care about who you are (we often speak of it as being a _flat_, or _neutral_, network). Structure your transaction and your bytes correctly, and the network will propagate your payment. Own the keys to your coins, and the protocol will recognize the legitimacy of your claim to those coins. 

This bears similiarities to how the web operates. Anyone with a connection and a browser can go to _www.wikipedia.com_ and get access to the world's knowledge. No need to be anyone special; both wikipedia and bitcoin will treat you the same whether you're the richest person on earth or the poorest. This is fundamental, and another cornerstone of the project.

<br>

### Bitcoin is opt-in
Bitcoin is opt-in. No one is forcing you to use it. Every single person purchasing bitcoin has chosen to do so purposedly. This is a remarkable departure from the way we use the US dollar, for example, or any other government prescribed fiat currency. 

Money is half of every transaction we ever make. We tend to be very fond of our freedom to choose which cellphone to buy or which house to live in. The choice of which _money_ to use, however, is not allowed anywhere in the developed world; it is prescribed and severely enforced by governments.

<br>

### Why 21 million?
The exact number has very little importance; the fact that it has a hard cap is the real difference between bitcoin and other monies, and the consequences of that choice are explored below. As for the choice of 21 in the first place, we can only speculate as to why Satoshi choose it. He never justified or explained it.

<br>

### Aren't we going to run out of coins?
Bitcoin has an ultimate cap on its supply; there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins created. We can, however, always add decimal places in order to use smaller units of the currency. It's like how `1.0 = 1.00 = 1.000000`. As you add decimal places, the total number (21 million) itself doesn't change, but the units that can be used become smaller, and there are more of them. You can never "run out of coins".

<br>

### Bitcoin or bitcoin?
It is rather unfortunate that bitcoin the currency unit was named the same name as Bitcoin the protocol. But that's the gist of it. We speak of sending _bitcoin_ across the world (like sending _dollars_), but when we speak of the protocol itself, we capitalise the word (as in _Bitcoin is an open borderless neutral permissionless antifragile system_). As bitcoin increases in value, however, this problem shows up less in day-to-day life, as people are starting to speak of sending _satoshis_ to each other (satoshis are the smallest unit of bitcoin one can transact with (`0.00000001 btc`), just like the penny is the smallest amount of dollar one can send.

<br>

### One of these is not the same
Think of how easy/hard it is to accomplish each of these 3 tasks:  
1. Send an message across the world  
2. Send a hundredth of a penny across the world   
3. Send a million dollars across the world  

One of these is currently much easier than the others. Note that if the right to send messages effortlessly across the world was taken from you through KYC processes and IDs and international restrictions you might feel (rightfully) outraged. Note also that messages sent across the world using software rather than physical objects (for example by using WhatsApp or email rather than handwritten letters) open up the range of messages one can send, from entire gigabytes (movies for examples) to single letters ("k"), to single bytes if the user so wishes. These smaller messages were not economically feasible in the times of paper letters and stamps; today we use them hundreds of times a day. Software broadens the range of possibilities.

_The Philosophy of Liberty and the Bitcoin project are closely aligned._

<br>

### Bitcoin is apolitical
When you purchase bitcoin, you know that no government can come in and change it at will, debase it, or censor it. Bitcoin is not controlled by any one jursidiction; it is not subject to the wims of politicians. Very few currencies can say the same today.

<br><br><br>

_Because of its potentially disruptive effect, Bitcoin is inextricably tied to politics._

<br>

### Bitcoin and central banks' monetary policy
We are subject to the monetary policy of our central banks through our use of the currency they create and control. For most people in the developed world, this is not too much of a problem, because those central banks tend to behave predictably. But this power to pull and push on the money supply and influence inflation is only made possible by the monopoly they have over the money used by their citizens. The ability to opt-out of your country's fiat money system takes away power from the central bank to target and control inflation. This ability will not be relinquished easily.

<br>

### Bitcoin offers the potential to separate money and State
Religion and State used to be very much the same in the developed world; they were separated for the better over the last century. Bitcoin offers a way to do the same with money and State. 

The same way we think of our religious leaders making decisions about minimum wage legislation as a rather odd idea, we might come to think of having our politicians in charge of the money supply as being silly in retrospect.
