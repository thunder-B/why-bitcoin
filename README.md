# Bitcoin

Wrapping our minds around what bitcoin is, what is special about it, and what it aims to achieve is plain hard. Whether you want to love it or hate it, _understanding_ it is the first step of the journey. Most often, we don't even know what to ask or where to start. 

The following are starting points to explore what bitcoin is and what makes the project important and special. They are neither exhaustive nor meant to be used for in-depth learning or worse, gospel, but rather as places to sink your teeth into, grapple with the concepts foundational to bitcoin, and maybe start asking your nearest bitcoin enthusiast some questions.

*Some of the basics to get you going.*

<br>

### Bitcoin is permissionless
You don't need any permission to develop on bitcoin, or to use bitcoin. This is a cornerstone of the system. You don't need an ID to send a payment, to recieve a payment, or to write another programming language library and integrate bitcoin into your website or business. Connect to the network, and you can use it.

<br>

### Bitcoin is open
Bitcoin is open for everyone to participate. This include its governance, its implementation, and its code. Everything is out in the open. There is no "insider information", no secret meetings. The code is open source, and the process through which the many bitcoin implementations change and upgrade is for all to see, comment, debate, and participate in. Come and join us.

### Bitcoin is a neutral network
Bitcoin doesn't care about who you are (we often speak of it as being a _flat_, or _neutral_, network). Structure your transaction and your bytes correctly, and the network will propagate your payment. Own the keys to your coins, and the protocol will recognize the legitimacy of your claim to those coins. 

This bears similiarities to how the web operates. Anyone with a connection and a browser can go to _www.wikipedia.com_ and get access to the world's knowledge. No need to be anyone special; both wikipedia and bitcoin will treat you the same whether you're the richest person on earth or the poorest. This is fundamental, and another cornerstone of the project.

### Bitcoin is opt-in
Bitcoin is opt-in. No one is forcing you to use it. Every single person purchasing bitcoin has chosen to do so purposedly. This is a remarkable departure from the way we use the US dollar, for example, or any other government prescribed fiat currency. 

Money is half of every transaction we ever make. We tend to be very fond of our freedom to choose which cellphone to buy or which house to live in. The choice of which _money_ to use, however, is not allowed anywhere in the developed world; it is prescribed and severely enforced by governments.

### Aren't we going to run out of coins?
Bitcoin has an ultimate cap on its supply; there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins created. We can, however, always add decimal places in order to use smaller units of the currency. It's like how `1.0 = 1.00 = 1.000000`. As you add decimal places, the total number (21 million) itself doesn't change, but the units that can be used become smaller, and there are more of them. You can never "run out of coins".

### Why 21 million?
The exact number has very little importance; the fact that it has a hard cap is the real difference between bitcoin and other monies, and the consequences of that choice are explored below. As for the choice of 21 in the first place, we can only speculate as to why Satoshi choose it. He never justified or explained it.
