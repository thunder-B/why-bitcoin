Wrapping our minds around what bitcoin is, what is special about it, and what it aims to achieve is plain hard. Whether you want to love it or hate it, _understanding_ it is the first step of the journey. Most often, we don't even know what to ask or where to start.

### Bitcoin is permissionless
You don't need any permission to develop on bitcoin, or to use bitcoin. This is a cornerstone of the system. You don't need an ID to send a payment, to recieve a payment, or to write another programming language library and integrate bitcoin into your website or business. Connect to the network, and you can use it.
